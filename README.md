# Personalized-Book-Recommendation-System
A desktop application that offers personalized book recommendations based on user preferences This project is a Personalized Book Recommendation System that utilizes the Google Books API to fetch book information dynamically and stores it in a MySQL database. The backend is implemented in Python and uses a MySQL database running inside a Docker container for persistent storage. The application will be expanded to include a user-friendly GUI, allowing users to interact with the book database effortlessly. The project is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy future enhancements and collaboration. 

### Prerequisites Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
Internet Connection\
Docker

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Project
Open you terminal and clone the project.\
Keep the terminal open and proceed with the rest of the instructions.

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file by copying from `.env.example` into the project root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open the `.env` file and fill in the environment variables with the information provided by the group. (Request the necessary values from the project organizer if you donâ€™t have them).\
Save the `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

### 3. Start the Docker Containers
To start the project and the necessary Docker containers, go to the project root directory and run:
```bash
./run.sh
```
### 4. Connect to the Database:
```bash
./connect_db.sh
```
When prompted, enter the database password (this is the MYSQL_PASSWORD you set in the `.env` file). Now you can run queries to inspect the main database.
```bash
USE books_database;
```
```bash
SELECT * FROM books;
```
To exit the database, simply type:
```bash
exit;
```

### 5. Test the Project
To search for a specific book, modify the book_title variable in `test_client.py`, save the changes, and run `./client_run.sh` again.\
To test the project, run the client script:
```bash
./client_run.sh
```
After running, revisit the database to see the books that have been added.

### 6. Stop the Docker Containers
To stop the running containers, use:
```bash
./stop.sh
```
### Note:
More functions and GUI enhancements are in progress!
